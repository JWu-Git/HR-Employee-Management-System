# HR-Employee-Management-System

This is an program for Human Resources to manage employees.

The user will have the option to add employees, lay off employees, rehire employees,
display the current active employees (linked list) or quit.
• A counter will be set for the number of current active employees.
• The employee linked list is to be maintained and displayed in sorted order.
• In the event an employee is laid-off, he/she will be removed from the active employee list
and the LayOff, and will be place in the ReHire.
• If an employee is rehired, he/she will be removed from the ReHire and added to the
active employee and LayOff
• The main program should consist of just the options (print statements are enough) and
appropriate method calls. All of the “work” will be calls to the sortedLinkedList, stack
and queue.
